# EE30321
Developing an understanding of **Harvard architecture microcontrollers** and related Embedded Systems using the popular 16-bit **PIC24 in MPLAB X**.  Coverage includes everything from the basic building blocks of a microcontroller (working registers, file registers, special function registers, Assembly) to implementation of **real-time control systems in C** (using serial communications via **RS-232**, **I2C** with multiple slaves, **data structures**, and **optimization techniques**).

_All projects are implemented on a breadboard I assembled (the PIC on the right is the PIC24 for this course, the one on the left is a PIC18 I use for personal experimentation)._

Skills Covered:

### Assignment 2, 3, 4

- Binary and Hexadecimal representation and mathematics
- Assembly usage in creating time-sensitive software
- Experience with **In-Circuit Serial Programming**
- **Simulation** experience in MPLABX
- Additional practice with code organiztion and commenting
- General **architectural designs** of microcontrollers
- **Pointers** and **Arrays**

### Assignment 5

- Push / Pop
- **The Stack** and Stack Overfl0w
- Branching in Assembly and Subroutines


### Assignment 6

- Real-time control system development in **C**
- Real-time control system development in **Assembly**
- Experience with general **Input / Output** capabilities
- Configuration of **Control Registers**
- Rerouting **Remappable Pins**

### Assignment 7

- Re-implemented a **more efficient** version of Assignemnt 6
- Hardware **Interrupts**
- **Interrupt Vector Tables** and Interrupt Priorities
- **Timer** configuration and usage
- Output Compare Module usage for **PWM generation**
- Internal **Pull-Up / Pull-Down** Resistors

### Assignment 8

- **RS-232 Communication**
- **UART** module configuration and usage
- **I2C Communication**
- **Real-time data transfer** between PIC24 host and (temperature chip) slave
- Proper configuration of a myriad of modules onboard the PIC24
- Significant Debugging experience
