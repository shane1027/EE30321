# EE30321
Developing an understanding of Harvard architecture microcontrollers and related Embedded Systems using the popular 16-bit PIC24.  Coverage includes everything from the basic building blocks of a microcontroller (working registers, file registers, special function registers, Assembly) to implementation of **real-time control systems in C** (using _serial communications_ via RS-232, _I2C_ with multiple slaves, _data structures_, and _optimization techniques_).

All projects are implemented on a breadboard I assembled (the PIC on the right is the PIC24 for this course, the one on the left is a PIC18 I use for personal experimentation).

Skills Covered:

### Assignment 2, 3, 4

- Binary and Hexadecimal representation and mathematics
- Assembly usage in creating time-sensitive software
- Experience with In-Circuit Serial Programming
- Simulation experience in MPLABX
- Additional practice with code organiztion and commenting
- General architectural properties of microcontrollers

### Assignment 5

### Assignment 6

- Real-time control system development in C
- Real-time control system development in Assembly
- Experience with general Input / Output capabilities
- Configuration of Remappable Pins

### Assignment 7

- Re-implemented a more efficient version of Assignemnt 6
- Hardware Interrupts
- Interrupt Vector Tables and Interrupt Priorities
- Timer configuration and usage
- Output Compare Module usage for PWM generation
- Internal Pull-Up / Pull-Down Resistors

### Assignment 8

- Implementation of Serial RS-232 Communication
- Implementation of I2C Communication
- Real-time data transfer between PIC24 host and (temperature chip)
- Proper configuration of a myriad of modules onboard the PIC24
- Significant Debugging experience
